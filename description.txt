This mod adds replacement Calamity songs for the vanilla Terraria soundtrack and music boxes for each song replaced.

It is intended to be used alongside the Calamity Mod, but can be used alone.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MOD DOES NOT ADD ANY CALAMITY GAME CONTENT.
You need to install the Calamity Mod for items, bosses, and so on.
